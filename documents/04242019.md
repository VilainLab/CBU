**Agenda**
1. **Project Status:**
a) Keller TCR RNAseq: Project results handed over to the investigators. 
b) Single cell RNA seq (Vittorio lab): Project result handed over to the investigator. We might need to re-run this analysis as we were provided with the final read counts only, and the investigator wants to run the analysis pipeline with the raw data once they receive the raw data.
c) RNA-seq (Ishibashi Lab): Project result handed over to the investigator.
2. **Upcoming Projects**
a) Single cell RNAseq (Jaiswal Lab): This is going to be a quick turnaround project as the results would be needed for June grant submission.
3. **Script Folder**
Made a script folder in the github page, where currently storing the pipeline scripts and linux one liners.
4. **Next Seminar**
Seth has volunteered for the next workshon Whole Genome sequencing analysi techniques, which would be held in the last week of May.
5. **Guidelines for Submission of Data to CBU**
Creating a document along with hiroki for information and files required for the analysis of genomic dataset to happen/
